  <p>In this paper, I built upon previous research by John Kain, who in the 1960s coined the “Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis.” He found that Black workers who largely resided in cities faced reverse commutes to get to jobs in the suburbs, and therefore more likely to have increased commute times and friction in finding work.</p>

<p>Using updated American Time Use Survey Data, I find that Black workers face higher commute times, just as Kain did. Additionally, the results show that for every 10% increase in wage, Black workers’ commuting time decreases an average of 2%. This same relationship does not hold for non-Black workers. In short – the Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis has continued revelance in this decade and requires smarter policy solutions aimed at workers who may be underserved by current systems.</p>
