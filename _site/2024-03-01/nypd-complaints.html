<h2 id="data-released-by-the-civilian-complaint-review-board-shows-that-the-highest-percentage-of-complaints-against-police-were-substantiated-than-ever-before-in-2020-while-complaints-with-penalties-were-at-an-all-time-low">Data released by the Civilian Complaint Review Board shows that the highest percentage of complaints against police were substantiated than ever before in 2020, while complaints with penalties were at an all-time low.</h2>

<p>The highest percentage of substantiated complaints against N.Y.P.D. officers went without discipline in 2020, despite the highest number of substantiated complaints on record, a review of Civilian Complaint Review Board data demonstrates.</p>

<p>In 2020, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent city agency of civilian investigators responsible for researching allegations against the N.Y.P.D., recommended over 600 complaints for discipline to the police commissioner. These are considered “substantiated complaints.” It was the highest number of substantiated complaints sent to the N.Y.P.D. since the board began in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Of the 600 complaints, 259 went without any penalty. Although the absolute number of punishments doled out is similar to other years on record, that trend obfuscates that the N.Y.P.D. let complaints go without punishment three times more in 2020 compared to the average.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/nypd/no_penalty_complaints_perc.png" alt="2020 was the year with the highest proportion of complaints without penalty" /></p>

<p>Clashes and allegations of abuse concerning the N.Y.P.D.’s handling of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests raised concerns about police accountability. A 590-page report from the C.C.R.B. says during the summer’s protests, it received 321 complaints within its jurisdiction, substantiating 88 of them.</p>

<p>At the same time, the C.C.R.B. received the lowest overall number of complaints–substantiated or unsubstantiated–from the public since 2006. The board recommended nearly 27 percent of these complaints for punishment in 2020 compared to a previous average of eight percent.</p>

<p>Despite this increase in substantiated complaints and decrease in total received complaints, a New York Times analysis of the C.C.R.B. data in late 2020 found that the N.Y.P.D. “regularly ignored the board’s recommendations, overruled them or downgraded the punishments, even when police officials confirmed that the officers had violated department regulations.”</p>

<p>The Civilian Complaint Review Board began releasing police complaint data in the summer of 2020 after New York repealed a law shielding complaints against officers. The current form of the board started under Mayor Durkin in 1992 despite active protest from the police. Its main task is to investigate and recommend action due to complaints against N.Y.P.D officers.</p>

<p>The union representing the N.Y.P.D. also pursued unsuccessful legal action against the New York Civil Liberties Union when it released the same database in August 2020 before the city ultimately released the complete records. The N.Y.C.L.U. reported that the C.C.R.B. substantiates few complaints while even fewer get punished.</p>

<p>This new data analysis reveals that even in the face of increasing substantiated complaints from the C.C.R.B., the N.Y.P.D. lessened penalties for more complaints than ever before in 2020.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/nypd/year_substanciated_complaints_count.png" alt="2020 was also the year with the most substanciated complaints" /></p>

<p>When the C.C.R.B. sends a complaint to the office of the N.Y.P.D. there is no legal responsibility for the department to pursue any punishment. The Administrative Prosecution Unit, a section of the C.C.R.B. that argues in front of the Deputy Commissioner of Trials, prosecutes a small percentage of these complaints. However, penalties are still at the final discretion of the Police Commissioner.</p>

<p>Typically, the N.Y.P.D. assigns around 35 to 40 percent of disciplined complaints from the C.C.R.B. with “Instructions” or “Formalized Training,” the lowest levels of punishment, meant for officers who misunderstand policy. This level of punishment entails verbal instructions from a superior or more formalized training. In 2020, this proportion dropped precipitously, and a similar proportion now goes without penalty. In an average year, only 1.5% of complaints result in a dismissal or resignation of the offending officer. That percentage comprises an average of one dismissed officer and five who resign. In 2020, nine officers resigned and the chief dismissed one officer due to the C.C.R.B complaints.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/nypd/complaints_by_category.png" alt="Extreme penalties dramatically decreased in 2020 " /></p>

<p>The source of the spike in complaints lies in two increases: the absolute number of officers who had a substantiated complaint in 2020 and the number of complaints per officer. The C.C.R.B substantiated complaints against 867 unique officers in 2020 compared to 694 in 2019 and 488 in 2018.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/nypd/officers_per_year.png" alt="Complaints increased by unique cops" /></p>

<p>When ranked by the number of complaints received, the top ten percent of N.Y.P.D. officers typically make up around 30 percent of total complaints. In 2020, however, the top ten percent accounted for nearly 50 percent of complaints.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/nypd/decade_deciles.png" alt="The worst cops got worse in 2020" /></p>

<p>In this case, the officers with the highest number of complaints against them contributed more to the slew of allegations in 2020 compared to other years, while most officers only had one complaint lodged against them.</p>

<p>“Protests against police brutality bred more instances of police misconduct,” Ava Rice, the chair of the C.C.R.B., said in the 2020 report. “If this misconduct goes unaddressed, it will never be reformed.”</p>
