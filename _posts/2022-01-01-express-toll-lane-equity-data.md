excerpt: "Using data on each trip taken on the I-405 express toll lanes during operational hours; demographic data on census block groups; and lane speed, volume, and travel time data, we studied how the express toll lanes are used, the benefits they provide to the region, and how these benefits are distributed among different groups of noncommercial users."
