# About Me

I work at The New York Times as a senior data analyst for the Games team where we seek to understand what can make our games more engaging and enjoyable.

I used to work as a data scientist at Expedia on **[geotesting](https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/market-segmentation-for-geo-testing-at-scale-8d593e0aa755)** and mobile marketing, a research intern at the Brookings Institution visualizing **[income inequality and tax burdens](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tackling-the-tax-code-efficient-and-equitable-ways-to-raise-revenue/)**, and a fellow with Data Science for Social Good at the University of Washington researching a form of **[congestion pricing](https://escience.washington.edu/data-science-for-social-good-team-analyzes-equity-of-congestion-pricing-on-interstate-405/)** in Washington State. 

I enjoy transit, coffee, and games.
